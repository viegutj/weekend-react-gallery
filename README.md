## Description
This weekend, I built a CRUD app using React that displays to the DOM, can be conditionally rendered using state, and can be removed from the DOM and database.

I learned about mapping where data goes in a React front-end framework, and how to pass data between components. I also learned how to use flexbox with react components.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
