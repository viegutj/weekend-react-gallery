## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This weekend, I built a CRUD app using React that displays to the DOM, can be conditionally rendered using state, and can be removed from the DOM and database.

I learned about mapping where data goes in a React front-end framework, and how to pass data between components.
